title: 'Reducing the burden of osteoarthritis in Aotearoa New Zealand (2022-2027)'
---

Our research centre was awarded an HRC Programme grant to investigate optimal ways to improve the management of osteoarthritis in NZ. This research programme involves a randomised clinical trial of a novel lifestyle intervention consisting of exercise therapy, dietary change, and self-management education, for people with osteoarthritis and multimorbidity; epidemiological and health economic research on the impacts of osteoarthritis prevention and management strategies, and health economic simulation modelling to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of novel treatment pathways and models of care for osteoarthritis in the New Zealand healthcare system. I am leading the simulation modelling project within this research programme. For more information on this programme, please see the [CMOR website](https://uo-cmor.github.io/our-work).
