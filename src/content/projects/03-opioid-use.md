title: 'Chronic opioid use before and after joint replacement surgery (2018-ongoing)'
---

I have received grants from the Otago Medical Research Foundation and the H.S and J.C Anderson Charitable Trust for studies of the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of chronic opioid use before and after total hip and knee replacement surgery, using linked national population data from the IDI. Several outputs from this project are now available:

* We showed, using a comprehensive dataset including all joint replacement surgeries performed in the NZ public healthcare system, the continued prevalence of opioid use for as long as three years after surgery. This work has been published in the New Zealand Medical Journal and presented to the NZ Orthopaedic Association Annual Scientific Meeting.
* A second paper from this project identifies several important risk factors that can to help identify patients at high risk of such prolonged post-surgical opioid use, which could be useful in identifying targeted interventions to reduce opioid exposure for these at-risk groups. This paper has been published in the [Journal of Arthroplasty](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.06.040).
* A third study investigates the long-term health, economic, and social impacts of perioperative opioid prescribing, and shows substantial increases in healthcare use and costs associated with preoperative opioid prescribing, but little evidence of any negative impacts of postoperative opioid prescribing to support short-term surgical recovery. This study has been published in [Family Practice](https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmad112).
* A further study looking at the dose-response relationship between preoperative opioid use and long-term outcomes is in progress. An analysis plan is freely available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/g52kt/), and a preliminary report will be published shortly.
